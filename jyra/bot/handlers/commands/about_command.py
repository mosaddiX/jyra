Jyra isn't just a bot. She's an emotionally aware companion who learns, grows, and remembers â€” all for you. Whether you want a late-night talk, a silly roleplay, or someone to just 'get it' â€” she's always there, glowing quietly like the light she was named after.

Jyra is a fusion of Jyoti (light) and Aura (presence, emotion) - a name born from light, designed to listen, respond, and understand.
