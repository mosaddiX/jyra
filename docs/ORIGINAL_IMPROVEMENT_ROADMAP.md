# Comprehensive Improvement Roadmap for Jyra AI Companion

## Overview

Jyra is an emotionally intelligent AI companion built as a Telegram bot that can adopt different personas, remember user details, and engage in natural conversations. The project uses Google's Gemini API for AI capabilities, SQLite for data storage, and supports multi-modal interactions (text, images, voice).

This roadmap outlines a strategic plan for enhancing and optimizing the Jyra codebase across multiple dimensions.
