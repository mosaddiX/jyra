# Memory Management Improvements for Jyra Bot

This document summarizes the improvements made to the memory management system in the Jyra bot.

## Memory Categories

We've implemented a comprehensive memory categorization system:

1. **Expanded Categories** - Added more categories for better organization:
   - Personal

   - Food
   - Finance
   - Hobbies
   - General

2. **Category-Specific Views** - Each category now has its own dedicated view with:
   - Category-specific memory listing
   - Category-specific search
   - Category-specific export
   - Category-specific importance filtering
   - Category-specific date view

3. **Category Browser** - Added a dedicated interface for browsing memory categories

## Memory Search Functionality

The memory search functionality has been enhanced with:

1. **Category-Specific Search** - Search within specific categories
2. **Global Search** - Search across all categories
3. **Search Results Formatting** - Better formatting of search results with importance indicators
4. **Search Context** - Maintain search context for better navigation

## Memory Importance Levels

We've implemented a comprehensive importance level system:

1. **Importance Filtering** - Filter memories by importance level (1-5)
2. **Importance Indicators** - Visual indicators (stars) for memory importance
3. **Important Memories View** - Dedicated view for high-importance memories
4. **Importance-Based Sorting** - Sort memories by importance level

## Additional Features

We've added several new features to enhance memory management:

1. **Memory Export** - Export memories to markdown files:
   - Export all memories
   - Export category-specific memories
   - Formatted export with importance indicators and dates

2. **Memory Import** - Import memories from text files with format:
   - Category|Importance|Memory Content

3. **Date-Based Views** - View memories organized by date:
   - Group by month/year
   - Sort chronologically
   - Format dates for readability

4. **Recent Memories** - Quick access to recently added memories

5. **Memory Map** - Placeholder for future visual memory map feature

## User Interface Improvements

The memory management interface has been improved with:

1. **Enhanced Navigation** - Better navigation between memory views
2. **Contextual Buttons** - Context-specific buttons for each view
3. **Consistent Formatting** - Consistent formatting of memory displays
4. **Visual Indicators** - Visual indicators for importance and categories
5. **Improved Instructions** - Better instructions for memory management

## Implementation Details

### Memory Model Enhancements

The Memory model has been enhanced to support importance levels:

```python
@classmethod
async def get_memories(cls, user_id: int, category: Optional[str] = None,
                       limit: Optional[int] = None, min_importance: int = 0,
                       max_importance: Optional[int] = None) -> List['Memory']:
    """
    Get memories for a user.

    Args:
        user_id (int): User ID
        category (Optional[str]): Filter by category
        limit (Optional[int]): Maximum number of memories to retrieve
        min_importance (int): Minimum importance level (0-5)
        max_importance (Optional[int]): Maximum importance level (0-5)

    Returns:
        List[Memory]: List of Memory objects
    """
```

### Memory Keyboard Enhancements

The memory keyboard has been enhanced with more options:

```python
def create_memory_keyboard(show_categories: bool = False) -> InlineKeyboardMarkup:
    """
    Create the memory management keyboard.
    
    Args:
        show_categories: Whether to show the category selection view
        
    Returns:
        An InlineKeyboardMarkup instance with memory management buttons
    """
```

### Category-Specific Keyboard

A new keyboard has been added for category-specific views:

```python
def create_memory_category_keyboard(category: str, has_memories: bool = True) -> InlineKeyboardMarkup:
    """
    Create a keyboard for a specific memory category.
    
    Args:
        category: The memory category
        has_memories: Whether the category has memories
        
    Returns:
        An InlineKeyboardMarkup instance with category-specific buttons
    """
```

## User Experience

These improvements enhance the user experience by:

1. **Organization** - Better organization of memories makes it easier to find information
2. **Prioritization** - Importance levels help prioritize critical information
3. **Contextual Access** - Category-specific views provide contextual access to memories
4. **Data Management** - Export and import features enable better data management
5. **Temporal Context** - Date-based views provide temporal context for memories

## Next Steps

Potential future improvements to the memory management system:

1. **Memory Relationships** - Establish relationships between related memories
2. **Memory Tags** - Add tagging system for more flexible categorization
3. **Memory Analytics** - Provide insights and analytics about memory usage
4. **Memory Visualization** - Implement the memory map feature for visual exploration
5. **Memory Reminders** - Set reminders based on important memories
