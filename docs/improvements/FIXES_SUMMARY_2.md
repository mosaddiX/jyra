# Fixes for Jyra Bot Issues - Round 2

This document summarizes the additional fixes made to resolve the issues with the Jyra bot.

## 1. Fixed Gemini Embedding API Integration

### Updated API Endpoint
- Changed the API endpoint from `v1beta` to `v1`
- Updated the endpoint from `embedText` to `embedContent`
- Fixed the payload format to match the new API requirements

### Fixed Response Parsing
- Updated the response parsing to handle the new response format
- Added proper error handling for API responses
- Improved logging for embedding generation

## 2. Fixed Vector Database Serialization

### Enhanced Embedding Serialization
- Updated the `_serialize_embedding` method to handle different embedding formats
- Added support for dictionary-based embeddings
- Implemented proper extraction of embedding values from different formats

### Added Fallback Mechanisms
- Added OpenAI embeddings as a fallback for Gemini embeddings
- Improved error handling for embedding generation
- Added proper logging for embedding storage

## 3. Fixed Missing Columns in Roles Table

### Created Migration Script
- Added a new migration script to add missing columns to the roles table
- Added `is_featured` and `is_popular` columns
- Created indexes for the new columns

### Updated Database Initialization
- Added the new migration to the database initialization process
- Improved error handling for database migrations
- Added proper logging for database changes

## 4. Fixed Memory Semantic Search

### Enhanced Semantic Search
- Updated the semantic search method to use OpenAI embeddings as a fallback
- Improved error handling for embedding generation
- Added proper logging for search results

### Fixed Embedding Generation
- Updated the embedding generation process to handle different embedding formats
- Added fallback mechanisms for embedding generation
- Improved error handling for embedding storage

## Benefits of These Fixes

### Improved Reliability
- The bot now works with both Gemini and OpenAI embeddings
- Fallback mechanisms ensure the bot continues to work even if one service fails
- Better error handling throughout the codebase

### Better User Experience
- Semantic search now works reliably
- Memory embeddings are generated and stored correctly
- Commands for memory management work as expected

### Enhanced Development Experience
- Clear logging makes it easier to diagnose issues
- Proper error handling makes it easier to fix problems
- Migration scripts make it easier to update the database

## Next Steps

1. Implement memory visualization to show relationships between memories
2. Add advanced memory consolidation using semantic clustering
3. Implement memory decay based on relevance and age
4. Add cross-user knowledge sharing for common information
5. Implement more sophisticated embedding models and techniques
