# Semantic Search Implementation for Jyra Bot

This document summarizes the implementation of semantic search for the memory system in Jyra bot.

## 1. Vector Embedding System

We've implemented a comprehensive vector embedding system with the following components:

### Embedding Generator
- Created an `EmbeddingGenerator` class that generates vector embeddings for text
- Supports multiple embedding models (Gemini and OpenAI)
- Includes fallback mechanisms for reliability
- Provides utility functions for similarity calculations

### Vector Database
- Implemented a `VectorDatabase` class for storing and retrieving embeddings
- Uses SQLite for persistent storage of embeddings
- Supports efficient similarity search
- Handles serialization and deserialization of vector data

## 2. Database Schema Updates

We've enhanced the database schema to support vector embeddings:

### New Tables
- Added `memory_embeddings` table to store vector embeddings for memories
- Created proper foreign key relationships with the memories table
- Added indexes for efficient querying

### Migration Script
- Created a migration script to update existing databases
- Ensures backward compatibility
- Adds necessary tables and indexes

## 3. Memory Model Enhancements

We've updated the Memory model to support semantic search:

### Embedding Integration
- Added automatic embedding generation when memories are created
- Updated memory deletion to also remove associated embeddings
- Added methods to update embeddings when memories change

### Semantic Search Methods
- Implemented `semantic_search` method for finding similar memories
- Added support for similarity thresholds and result limits
- Created helper methods for retrieving memory details

## 4. Memory Manager Updates

We've enhanced the memory manager to use semantic search:

### Relevant Memory Retrieval
- Updated `get_relevant_memories` to use semantic search
- Added fallback to keyword search when appropriate
- Improved memory filtering and sorting

### Search Interface
- Enhanced `search_memories` method to support both semantic and keyword search
- Added parameters for controlling search behavior
- Improved error handling and logging

## 5. Command Interface

We've added commands for interacting with the semantic search system:

### Generate Embeddings Command
- Added `/generate_embeddings` command to create embeddings for existing memories
- Provides feedback on the embedding generation process
- Handles errors gracefully

### Search Memories Command
- Added `/search_memories` command for semantic search
- Displays search results with similarity scores
- Formats results for easy reading

## Implementation Details

### Embedding Generation
The embedding generation process works as follows:
1. When a memory is created or updated, an embedding is automatically generated
2. The embedding is stored in the `memory_embeddings` table
3. The embedding can be used for semantic search

```python
# Generate embedding
embedding = await embedding_generator.generate_embedding(content)
                    
# Store embedding
await vector_db.store_embedding(memory_id, embedding)
```

### Semantic Search
The semantic search process works as follows:
1. Generate an embedding for the search query
2. Find memories with similar embeddings using cosine similarity
3. Retrieve the full memory details for the similar memories
4. Return the memories sorted by similarity

```python
# Generate embedding for the query
query_embedding = await embedding_generator.generate_embedding(query)
            
# Search for similar embeddings
similar_memories = await vector_db.search_similar(
    query_embedding=query_embedding,
    limit=limit or 10,
    min_similarity=min_similarity
)
```

## Benefits of Semantic Search

### For Users
- More accurate memory retrieval based on meaning rather than keywords
- Better conversation context with more relevant memories
- Improved user experience with faster and more accurate responses

### For Developers
- Clean, modular implementation that's easy to extend
- Support for multiple embedding models
- Efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings

### For the System
- More intelligent memory retrieval
- Better utilization of AI capabilities
- Foundation for more advanced features like clustering and topic modeling

## Next Steps

1. Implement memory visualization to show relationships between memories
2. Add advanced memory consolidation using semantic clustering
3. Implement memory decay based on relevance and age
4. Add cross-user knowledge sharing for common information
5. Implement more sophisticated embedding models and techniques
