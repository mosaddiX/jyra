# OpenAI Integration Changes for Jyra Bot

This document summarizes the changes made to the OpenAI integration in the Jyra bot.

## 1. Made OpenAI Optional

We've made OpenAI integration optional to avoid unexpected costs:

### Configuration Changes
- Added `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the configuration
- Added `ENABLE_OPENAI` flag (defaults to false)
- Updated config validation to check for OpenAI API key only if enabled

### Model Manager Changes
- Modified `ModelManager` to accept an `enable_openai` parameter
- Updated the singleton instance to use the `ENABLE_OPENAI` config
- Changed fallback model selection based on OpenAI availability

## 2. Skip OpenAI Models When Disabled

We've updated the model initialization to skip OpenAI models when disabled:

### Model Initialization
- Added a check in `_initialize_model` to skip OpenAI models if disabled
- Added logging to indicate when OpenAI models are skipped
- Improved model type detection to include "openai" in addition to "gpt"

## 3. Fallback to Gemini-Only Models

We've updated the fallback strategy to use only Gemini models when OpenAI is disabled:

### Fallback Strategy
- When OpenAI is disabled, fallback to "gemini-1.5-flash" and "gemini-1.5-pro"
- When OpenAI is enabled, fallback to "gpt-3.5-turbo" and "gemini-1.5-flash"
- Maintain the ability to specify custom fallback models

## How to Enable OpenAI

If you want to use OpenAI models, you can enable them by:

1. Setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your OpenAI API key
2. Setting the `ENABLE_OPENAI` environment variable to "true"

Example in your .env file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
ENABLE_OPENAI=true
```

## Benefits of These Changes

### Cost Control
- Prevents unexpected charges from OpenAI API usage
- Allows users to explicitly opt-in to using OpenAI

### Flexibility
- Maintains the ability to use OpenAI when desired
- Provides a smooth fallback to Gemini models

### Transparency
- Clearly logs when OpenAI models are skipped
- Validates configuration to ensure OpenAI API key is set when enabled

## Next Steps

1. Add usage tracking for API calls to monitor costs
2. Implement token counting to estimate costs before making API calls
3. Add more Gemini model options for better fallback options
4. Consider adding a command to temporarily enable/disable OpenAI
