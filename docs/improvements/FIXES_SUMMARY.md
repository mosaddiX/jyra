# Fixes for Jyra Bot Issues

This document summarizes the fixes made to resolve the issues with the Jyra bot.

## 1. Fixed User Model

### Added Missing Method
- Added the `get_all_users` method to the User class
- Implemented proper database query to retrieve all users
- Added error handling for the method

### Fixed Error Handling
- Removed the `@handle_exceptions` decorator from the `get_all_users` method
- This was causing issues because the decorator was expecting Telegram update and context parameters

## 2. Fixed Event Loop Issues

### Modified Main Function
- Changed the main function from async to sync
- Removed `asyncio.run()` and used direct method calls
- Simplified the application startup process

### Disabled Memory Maintenance Scheduler
- Temporarily disabled the memory maintenance scheduler
- This was causing event loop conflicts with the main application
- Can be re-enabled later with a proper implementation

## 3. Fixed Database Connection

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Updated the error handling in database methods
- Made sure all database operations are properly wrapped in try/except blocks
- Added proper logging for database errors

### Added Null Checks
- Added checks for empty results in database queries
- Implemented proper handling for cases when no users are found
- Added early returns to avoid processing empty data

## 4. Fixed Command Registration

### Centralized Command Registration
- Created a centralized module for registering all handlers
- Separated command, callback, and message handlers
- Improved organization and maintainability

### Added Memory Commands
- Added commands for memory management
- Implemented `/generate_embeddings` command
- Implemented `/search_memories` command

## Benefits of These Fixes

### Improved Stability
- The bot now starts and runs without errors
- No more event loop conflicts
- Proper error handling throughout the codebase

### Better Organization
- Centralized handler registration
- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved code maintainability

### Enhanced User Experience
- New commands for memory management
- Better error messages
- More reliable operation

## Next Steps

1. Re-enable the memory maintenance scheduler with proper implementation
2. Add more comprehensive error handling for edge cases
3. Implement proper logging for all operations
4. Add more user-friendly commands for memory management
